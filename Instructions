# PostgreSQL Database Connection and Operations with Python (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment and perform basic database operations.

## Prerequisites

1. **PostgreSQL:** Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. You can download it from the [PostgreSQL official site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. **Jupyter Notebook Python Libraries:** Install the necessary Python libraries (`psycopg2` for PostgreSQL connectivity and `pandas` for data manipulation) 
within your Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Note:** Once you've connected to the PostgreSQL database in your Jupyter Notebook, any changes you make, 
such as creating databases, will be reflected in the actual PostgreSQL database server you're connected to. You can verify this by using the PostgreSQL command-line tools.
